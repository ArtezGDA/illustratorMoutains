# Examples of Illustrator Scripts

This is a collection of a few scripts to be run in Illustrator:

- script that just runs in Illustrator: **expandedOutlines**
- script that exports to `.svg` files: **exportEachLayer**
- script that imports `.json` to modify artwork: **importJsonData**

## expandedOutlines

A Illustrator Javascript script to draw a set of expanded outlines around a given shape. The script is set to modify an exiting Illustrator document.

Follow the [Scripting Tutorial to Expanded Outlines](Tutorial_Scripting_ExpandedOutlines.md) to follow the steps I took in creating this.

## exportEachLayer

A Illustrator Javascript script to export each layer in a document to an SVG file. The script is not modifying the active Illustrator document, just exporting parts of it.

Follow the [Scripting Tutorial to Export Each Layer as SVG](Tutorial_Scripting_ExportEachLayer.md) to learn how to create this script yourself.

## importJsonData

A Illustrator Javascript script to modify an exiting Illustrator document, using external data from a JSON file. The data in the JSON is visualized with a path element in Illustrator.
