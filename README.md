# Examples of Illustrator Scripts

This is a collection of a few scripts to be run in Illustrator:

- script that just runs in Illustrator: **expandedOutlines**
- script that exports to `.svg` files
- script that imports `.json` to modify artwork

## expandedOutlines

A Illustrator Javascript script to draw a set of expanded outlines around a given shape. The script is set to modify an exiting Illustrator document.

Follow the [Scripting Tutorial to Expanded Outlines](Tutorial_Scripting_ExpandedOutlines.md) to follow the steps I took in creating this.

**NOTE: This is just example code for teaching the *Media Design* classes in Arnhem. Do not expect clean reusable javascript modules.**
